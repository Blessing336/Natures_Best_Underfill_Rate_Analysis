# Project Background

Natures Best Juice Co., a leading producer of fresh orange fruit juices, launched an operational analysis project in response to a rising trend of underfilled bottles across its production lines. Over the past several weeks, the number of underfilled bottles has steadily increased, with a recent spike showing higher-than-expected underfill counts per batch. This issue has led to growing internal costs, batch inconsistencies, and concerns over meeting both regulatory standards and customer expectations.

The primary objective of this project is to **analyze, visualize, and interpret production line data with a focus on understanding the drivers of underfill**. Specific attention will be given to machine-level performance and nozzle activity, in order to quantify their impact on production quality. The investigation will **track key performance indicators such as underfill rate (%), underfill cost (â‚¦), juice wasted (litres), and months since last replacement**.

Ultimately, the goal is to **identify actionable insights** and **develop recommendations that will reduce underfill by at least 50%** in the coming quarter. Control measures will also be proposed to help the operations sustain improvements, and prevent recurrence of the recent spike.

## Key Analysis and Recommendation Areas

* Determine when the underfill trend began and how it has evolved
* Compare the KPIs before vs. after the issue became noticeable
* Identify patterns tied to nozzles
* Deliver a data-backed Root Cause Analysis with clear explanations and recommendations for the Operations team

# Executive Summary

Natures Best Juice Co. is facing a concentrated underfill problem that escalated rapidly after **June 28, 2025**. From that date, **underfill cost increased by 675% within just 18 days** compared with the entire four months prior, indicating a clear inflection point and sustained deterioration across recent batches.

The issue is not evenly distributed. Line 1 is the clear hotspot, with **filler nozzles 2 and 4 showing the highest underfill rates** relative to peer nozzles. Before the spike, core KPIs (underfill rate, units underfilled cost, and juice waste (litres)) were stable and within tolerance; after the spike, these KPIs rose sharply, with repeated exceedances across multiple consecutive batches.
